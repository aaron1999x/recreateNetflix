# Netflix Landing page practice

This is a practice project where i recreated my own version of the Netflix landing page using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript for the tabs. Modern CSS3+ techniques such as Grid, Flex, overlays, shadows,tables and responsive media queries are used.

- Most of the buttons do not redirect anywhere. However the website is responsive. The website will scale accordingly when viewed on a table or phone.
- JS is used for switching between the three infomation tabs.
